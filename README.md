<p>It was instituted by papal bull Inter gravissimas dated 24 February 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar is named. The motivation for the adjustment was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church.</p><br />
<h3>Age Calculator Formula</h3><br />
<p>The Oxford Dictionary defines “Age” as the length of time that a person has lived or a thing has existed. The method of calculating age involves the comparison of a person's date of birth with the date on which the age needs to be calculated. The date of birth is subtracted from the given date, which gives the age of the person. i.e., Age formula = Given date - Date of birth. The steps to calculate a person's age from his date of birth to a given date are listed below.<br />

<b>Step 1:</b> First, calculate the number of full years by subtracting the birth year from the current year. For example, if the current year is 2023 and the birth year is 2000, then the number of full years is 23.<br />
<b>Step 2:</b> Next, calculate the number of full months by subtracting the birth month from the current month. If the current month is less than the birth month, then subtract 1 from the number of full years and add 12 to the current month to compensate. Then do something (current month - birth month) For example, if the birth month is February and the current month is April, then the number of full months is 2. If the birth month is November and the current month is April, then the number of full months is 4 + 12 = 16 and the difference is 16 - 11 = 5.<br />
<b>Step 3:</b> Just as in Step 2, we calculate the number of days as well using the current date - birth date. But here, if current date < birth date, then subtract 1 from the number of full months and add 30/31/28/29 to the current date depending upon the number of days present in the previous month of the current month.<br />
<b>Step 4:</b> Finally, the age calculator expresses the age in years, months and days.</p><br />
<h3>Solved Examples of How to Calculate Age:</h3><br />
<p>Here are some examples that would give us more clarity on how to calculate age and what is the strategy used by the birthday calculator.<br />
Example 1: The date of birth of Ron is July 25, 1985 (25/07/1985). Find his age on January 28, 2021, and verify it using the age calculator.<br />
Solution:<br />
Using the formula to calculate Ron's age:<br />
Age of a Person = Given date - Date of birth.<br />
Ron's Date of Birth = July 25, 1985.<br />
Given date = January 28, 2021.<br />
Note that the current month < birth month. i.e., January (1) < July (7). So we need to consider 2021 - 1 = 2020 as the current year and also do 12 + 1 (Jan) - 7 (July) = 6 months.<br />
Years' Difference = 2020 - 1985 = 35 years.<br />
Number of remaining days = 3 days.<br />
Answer: ∴ Ron's age is 35 years, 6 months, 3 days.<br />
Example 2: Harry's date of birth is July 13, 1992. Find his age on April 21, 2016, and verify it using the age calculator.<br />
Solution:<br />
Using the formula to calculate Harry's age:<br />
Age of a Person = Present date - Date of birth.<br />
Here is a little different procedure to understand the age formula in a better way.<br />
Harry's Date of Birth = July 13, 1992.<br />
Years' Difference = 2015 - 1992 = 23 years. (This has been calculated from July 13, 1992 to July 13, 2015)<br />
Number of remaining months from 13 July 2015 to 13 April 2016 = 9 months.<br />
Number of remaining days from 13 April 2016 to 21 April 2016 = 8 days.<br />
Answer: ∴ Harry's age will be 23 years, 9 months, and 8 days.</p>
